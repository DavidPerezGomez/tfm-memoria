\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Resum}

Text with a summary of the project, that is, a concise explanation of the project/problem addressed, its objectives/resolution methods, and the results and conclusions (it cannot be a list, but rather a continuous text written in a structured way). If a reference is necessary in this text, it will be noted at the bottom of the same page. In this section, a more literary and colloquial language can be used than for the rest of the document.

The Abstract will be written twice. One version must be \textbf{obligatorily in English}. The other version must be written in Catalan or Spanish. If the rest of the document is not written in English, it will be necessary to write the second version of the Abstract in the language used for the rest of the report. The word Abstract will be changed to \textbf{Resum}'' or \textbf{Resumen}'' in the Catalan and Spanish versions, respectively.

Recommended length: maximum 250 words.
